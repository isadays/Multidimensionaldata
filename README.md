# Multidimensionaldb
Multidimensional Expressions. MDX is used specifically for querying multidimensional data structures. MDX queries result in multidimensional data structures (cubes or cellsets).


In MDX, a tuple uniquely identifies a single data cell in a multidimensional cube by specifying exactly one member from each dimension involved.
